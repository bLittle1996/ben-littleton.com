        <p>
          Hi, I am a Canadian web developer based in Southern Ontario. I have
          been programming and creating things since I was 13 years old.
          Nowadays I strive to create web applications that make a positive
          difference in people{"'"}s lives, no matter how small. I strive to
          learn at least one new thing everyday so that I can be better equipped
          to make that difference. If you want to take a look at what
          technologies and frameworks I am comfortable with, take a look at my{" "}

              NativShark is an education platform for learning languages. It
              currently focuses on teaching Japanese. I joined the team right at
              the start of the project and was quickly tasked with building out
              the frontend - which is written using Next.js and React. I worked
              on just about every feature on the site: from the tools used to
              create lessons and content to the student-facing applications that
              consumed that content like the lesson pages, flashcards, and audio
              player.

              Jalup NEXT was a web app designed to teach Japanese from zero in a
              very natural way. I created the schema used by the app{"'"}s
              database and built the RESTful API to talk to that database. I
              coded several quality of life features, such as card searching,
              and designed and built the exploration feature using d3.js,
              Vue.js, and Vuex.
